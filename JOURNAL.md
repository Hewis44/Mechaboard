## 10/20/2025 - started with idea and researched about electronics  

Today I kinda went down a rabbit hole about how mechanical keyboards actually work. I started reading about this whole matrix thing, like how all the switches are wired in rows and columns and somehow the board can still figure out which exact key you pressed. It sounded complicated at first, but after watching a few videos it started to make sense. I was actually planning to use a Raspberry Pi Pico:

 for my build, but then I saw that most people prefer using an Arduino Pro Micro:

. It just seems way easier for loading QMK or VIA firmware, and it already has built-in USB, so that saves some trouble. I spent quite some time comparing both and finally decided I’ll stick with the Pro Micro. I also made a small list of things I’ll probably need later, like diodes and switches, maybe even a tiny OLED display if I feel fancy. But for now, I just wanna understand the electronics part properly. Feels good to finally start on something that’s been on my mind for so long.

  

## 10/21/2025 - Designed the schematic and routed the pcb  

So today I finally sat down and worked on the schematic for my keyboard. I actually switched back to using the Raspberry Pi Pico instead of the Pro Micro because there are just so many proper docs and examples for the Pico online, and it felt much easier to work with.

 I opened up EasyEDA and started connecting all the rows and columns for the matrix, double-checking the Pico pinout again and again just to be sure. It took a while to get everything right, but once it started coming together, it felt really nice. After finishing the schematic, I made the base PCB and began routing all the traces. Some parts got messy and I had to redo them a couple of times, but once the layout looked neat, it was honestly super satisfying to see. Watching the board slowly take shape on screen gave me that small “I actually made this” kind of feeling. Still a lot left to do, but today felt like a proper step forward.

## 10/23/2025 8:27 AM - Made some silkscreen and tried making a case on easyeda pro  

So today I designed the case for my keyboard in EasyEDA Pro, and honestly it was so fun seeing it come together. I made sure the mounting holes and the PCB edges aligned properly, then exported the whole thing and imported it into Fusion 360 to start working on the 3D model.

It looked so clean seeing the PCB sit inside the case, and I could finally imagine how the full keyboard will look once assembled. I also added a small touch on the PCB by putting a silkscreen of the Lockheed Martin logo, just because it looked super cool and gave the board a more professional vibe. I spent some time adjusting the dimensions so that the case feels compact but still gives enough space for all the components to fit nicely. The plan now is to start assembling everything soon once I’m happy with the fit. Seeing the design shift from just circuits to an actual body made it feel so real today.
