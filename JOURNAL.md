## 10/20/2025 - started with idea and researched about electronics  

Today I kinda went down a rabbit hole about how mechanical keyboards actually work. I started reading about this whole matrix thing, like how all the switches are wired in rows and columns and somehow the board can still figure out which exact key you pressed. It sounded complicated at first, but after watching a few videos it started to make sense. I was actually planning to use a Raspberry Pi Pico:

 for my build, but then I saw that most people prefer using an Arduino Pro Micro:

. It just seems way easier for loading QMK or VIA firmware, and it already has built-in USB, so that saves some trouble. I spent quite some time comparing both and finally decided I’ll stick with the Pro Micro. I also made a small list of things I’ll probably need later, like diodes and switches, maybe even a tiny OLED display if I feel fancy. But for now, I just wanna understand the electronics part properly. Feels good to finally start on something that’s been on my mind for so long.
